        You may write an unlimited number of airline reviews for any given airline. An airline review may include just an individual leg of a flight (e.g. London to New York) or the review may cover your entire return experience with an airline (e.g. London to New York to London) if operated by the same airline. If you had multiple stops, your review may also include these legs if it is with the same airline.`
